# Instructions for Setting Up A Development Environment:

1. Download Python from the internet at https://www.python.org/. You can also install Python using homebrew, or any other package manager of your choice.
2. Download VSCode from the internet. This will act as your text editor while coding.
3. Open a new folder in VSCode, and make sure you download the necessary Python extensions by searching Python in the extensions tab.
4. Open any included Python file and use the play button in the top right corner to run the file.
