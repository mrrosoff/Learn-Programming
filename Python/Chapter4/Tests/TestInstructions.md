## Background

The file forestfires.csv is included inside of this directory. The file has the following fields in the following 
order, one row is one entry. Each entry corresponds to a five minute interval at Mauna-Loa in Hawaii over an entire 
year.

1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec" 
4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 

## Your Task

Graph the following:

1. temperature vs day (line graph)
2. wind vs day (scatter plot)
3. area vs day (scatter plot with red squares)
4. Graph the Variable that has the best correlation with burned area. Demonstrate that this variable is best.
