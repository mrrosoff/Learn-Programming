### Learn C++ By Creating A Real World Product

## Overview

In this course, you will utilize C++ to produce a raytracing engine. A raytracer is a graphics program designed to create images from scratch, rendering views of objects coded into a scene. You may be familiar with a couple of industry leaders in raytracing technology, namely `Pixar`, and `Nvidia`. If you are already curious about raytracing and computer graphics, or if this course sparks your interest in the field, I highly recommend contacting me, and I can point you to some amazing sources.

## Instructions

1. Follow the [included instructions](./SettingUpDevEnv.md) to setup your development environment. 

2. Follow the instructions included with each chapter at your own pace. In each chapter, you will find files that explain a section of the language. Complete each file and then attempt the tests. 

3. At the end of the day, you should have learned the basics of C++!
