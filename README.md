# Learn-Python

### A Library of Python Files Used to Teach Python. 

Download the repository and follow the instructions included to setup your development environment. Then simply 
follow the instructions included with each chapter at your own pace. In Each file in Files you will find a file that 
explains a section of the Python programming language. Complete each file and then attempt the tests. 

At the end of the day, you should have learned Python! If you have any questions or concerns about the content feel free
 to make an issue and add me as the assignee. I will get back to you as soon as I can.
