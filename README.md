# Learn-Programming

### A Repository Of Programming Courses

## C++

Designed to teach a community college course, this C++ course was created to teach the basics of the programming language, while in parallel creating a product that students could be proud of. In the couse, you will design a raytracing engine to create dynamic images similar to the movies of `Pixar`.

## Python

In this course, students will work directly on source files and complete small tests to learn the basics of Python. Through four independent chapters, you will learn a small element of the language, and combine them to solve simple problems.
